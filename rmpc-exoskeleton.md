# Robust MPC for Tremor-Suppression Wrist Exoskeleton (TAWE)

<!--This project develops a **Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC)** framework for a wearable **wrist exoskeleton** designed to suppress tremor-induced disturbances while preserving voluntary motion. The controller is built for the **Tremor Alleviating Wrist Exoskeleton (TAWE)** and targets the dynamics and uncertainty patterns observed in **Essential Tremor (ET)**.

This project implements a **Robust Model Predictive Controller (RMPC)** for a **wearable wrist exoskeleton** to suppress tremor-induced motion while preserving natural voluntary movement. The controller is developed for the **Tremor Alleviating Wrist Exoskeleton (TAWE)** and targets the uncertainty patterns observed in **Essential Tremor (ET)**.

## 🦾 System Overview – TAWE Exoskeleton

- **Device:** Tremor Alleviating Wrist Exoskeleton (TAWE)  
- **DOFs:** 6-DoF rigid-link mechanism, with **2 actuated joints**:
  - Wrist Flexion/Extension (FE)
  - Radial/Ulnar Deviation (RUD)
- **Goal:** Suppress pathological tremor while allowing **natural voluntary wrist motion**
- **Sensing (for model & validation):** Encoders + IMU
- **Validation Mode:** High-fidelity numerical simulation

## 🎯 Problem Addressed

Patients with **Essential Tremor (ET)** experience involuntary oscillatory wrist motion (typically 4–12 Hz) that overlays voluntary movement and degrades task performance. A tremor-suppression controller must:

- **Reject involuntary tremor motion**
- **Preserve intended voluntary motion**
- Accommodate and remain robust to **patient-to-patient variability**

Standard MPC assumes nominal dynamics and degrades when tremor torques and user-specific variability deviate from the model. This motivates the need for an **explicitly robust control formulation**.

## 🧠 RMPC Approach – Key Ideas

The control strategy is based on a **vertex-based Robust MPC formulation** with a data-driven uncertainty set:

- **Reduced-order dynamic model:**  
  The constrained multibody dynamics of TAWE are reduced to a **2-DoF wrist model** in flexion/extension(FE) and radial/ulnar deviation(RUD) for control synthesis.

- **Data-driven disturbance modeling:**  
  - Tremor-like torque inputs are generated in the clinically relevant **3–7 Hz band**  
  - Resulting joint-velocity deviations are analyzed in **velocity space**  
  - A minimum-area **convex polygon** is fit to define a **bounded disturbance set**

- **Vertex-based uncertainty representation:**  
  - The uncertainty set is encoded as the **convex hull of 4 worst-case vertices**
  - RMPC enforces feasibility and robustness across **all vertices simultaneously**

- **State-dependent cost weighting (agility):**  
  - Each disturbance vertex is weighted based on **alignment with the current tracking error**
  - Vertices aligned with the dominant deviation direction are **penalized more heavily**
  - This increases **disturbance rejection exactly where tremor is most harmful**

- **Real-time oriented design:**  
  - Discrete-time control with **20 ms sampling time (50 Hz)**
  - Prediction horizon: **N = 15**
  - Balanced for **robustness vs. computational load**

## ⚙️ Controller Configuration (High Level)

- **State:** Wrist angles and angular velocities in FE and RUD  
- **Inputs:** Two actuator torques (FE and RUD)
- **Cost structure:**
  - High penalty on **position tracking error**
  - Moderate penalty on **velocity error**
  - Moderate penalty on **control effort**
- **Constraints:**
  - Joint limits
  - Torque limits
  - Wearable safety & comfort bounds

A **single robust optimization problem** is solved at each time step with a **shared first control input across all uncertainty vertices** to guarantee causality and robustness.

## 🧪 Simulation-Based Validation

The RMPC framework is validated through high-fidelity numerical simulations of the TAWE wrist exoskeleton under **clinically representative tremor-like torque disturbances** applied in the **3–7 Hz range**.

Simulation studies evaluate:
- Reference tracking under involuntary tremor inputs  
- Robustness to bounded user-specific disturbance uncertainty  
- Comparative performance against a **standard MPC controller**

All controller comparisons use identical:
- Initial conditions  
- Reference trajectories  
- Actuator limits  
- Joint constraints  

This ensures a **controlled and fair comparison** between MPC and RMPC.
