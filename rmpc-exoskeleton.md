# Robust MPC for Tremor-Suppression Exoskeleton

This project designs and implements a Robust Model Predictive Controller (RMPC) for a wrist exoskeleton to attenuate tremor-induced disturbances while preserving voluntary motion.

## Overview
- System: Wrist exoskeleton
- Goal: Tremor suppression with preserved voluntary motion
- Approach: Vertex-based RMPC under bounded disturbance models

## Experimental / Simulation Results

Add plots or snapshots showing:
- Reference vs. controlled motion
- Tremor attenuation performance
- Comparison vs. standard MPC

## Technical Highlights
- Robust MPC formulation with uncertainty vertices
- Real-time implementable formulation
- Improved tracking under tremor disturbances
