# Multi-Rate NMPC for Wall-Supported Bipedal Locomotion (Unitree Go2)

This project demonstrates a **real-time Multi-Rate Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (MR-NMPC)** that enables a **Unitree Go2 quadruped to rise into an upright, wall-supported bipedal configuration and locomote over uneven terrain** with high reliability.

The system is **fully deployed on hardware** and integrates:
- Footstep planning  
- Reaction force optimization  
- Whole-body tracking  

in a **single real-time control pipeline**.

## 🔧 System Overview

- **Robot:** Unitree Go2  
- **Control Stack:**
  - High-level planner: **Multi-Rate NMPC**
  - Low-level tracking: **Whole-Body Controller (500 Hz)**
- **Update Rates:**
  - Footstep planning: **3 Hz**
  - Reaction forces & CoM control: **50 Hz**
- **Deployment:** Real-time on physical hardware

## 🎯 Problem Addressed

Legged robots operating in upright or underactuated configurations face major challenges due to:

- **Sparse and changing footholds**
- **Uncertain contact geometry**
- **Strong dynamic coupling during rapid transitions**

Traditional MPC approaches rely on **heuristic footstep planning**, which limits robustness on highly uneven terrain.  
This project eliminates that limitation by **optimizing footsteps, forces, and body motion jointly inside MPC**.

---

## 🚀 Key Contributions

- **Unified optimization** of CoM motion, reaction forces, and discrete footsteps
- **Multi-rate real-time execution** enabling both fast stabilization and slow step adaptation
- **Contact-aware prediction**, allowing anticipation of upcoming contact domains
- **Fully hardware validated** on a dynamically unstable upright robotic configuration

---

## 🧪 Experimental Setup

- **Environment:** Random wooden-block terrain with limited and uneven footholds  
- **Configuration:** Dynamically unstable upright bipedal posture  
- **Stabilization strategy:** Monkey-like contact sequencing using front limbs for torso stabilization during transitions
